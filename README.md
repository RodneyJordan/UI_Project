                                        Proposal For User Interface Project
                                        
For the undergraduate group project that is being made for User Interface Fall 2015 a web application will be made that pulls
known issues of popular open source projects from GitHub and displays them in an easy to read fashion.

• Group Members: Rodney Jordan

• Who: This web app will be designed with developers in mind. However the application will
be able to be accessed by anyone who is interested in the content. With that in mind the design will have a modern webpage 
style and should be easy to navigate for even a novice web user.

• What: The web app will list issues 25 per page of popular open source projects such as Rails. Each entry on the default page will include the issue number and title, along with any labels. The entries will also show the user name and user avatar of the person posting the issue. This will then be followed by the first 140 characters of the issue. A detailed view will be available by clicking on an issue from the default page.

• When: The web page should be accessible at all times. This is assuming that the host where the web app resides is not experiencing an issue or that GitHub is not experiencing an issue.

• Where: The application will be available anywhere the Internet can be accessed. In general it will be assumed that the application will be accessed from a desktop computer or laptop computer. However the design will allow mobile users to easily read and navigate the app.

• Why: This application will provide a tool that will allow anyone interested in researching issues with open source projects, or even attempting to solve some of the issues.

• How: The web app will be navigated from a web browser. Any actions that are available on the web browser or the platform the user is accessing the app from.

Details: The web application will consist of multiple pages that list known issues for such open source projects as Rails, Scala, and AngularJS. A tab bar located at the top of the page will direct the user to the project that he or she may want to research or work on solving the issues. Each page will contain 25 entries from whatever project is selected. The entries will include the title and issue number, any labels that may accompany the issue, as well as the user name and avatar of the user that submitted the issue. The first 140 characters of the issue will be displayed as well. Upon clicking on any of the listed issues a detailed view will be presented. This will allow the user to further read the issue at hand. Other features that will be included time permitting would be a display for the official twitter account for each project that would display the last few tweets. Links to download the current version of the project in question. This would give the user the ability to work on one of the issues.

Languages and Frameworks: The vast majority of the application will be written in JavaScript and utilize Backbone.js (http://backbonejs.org). The look and style of the website will be done using the Foundation framework.
